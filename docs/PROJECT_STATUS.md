# Arlo Meeting Assistant — Project Status

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-13
**Version:** v1.0
**Spec:** See [`/SPEC.md`](../SPEC.md) for the authoritative feature specification and version milestones.

## Overview

Open-source Zoom Apps starter kit for building intelligent meeting assistants using RTMS (Real-Time Media Streams) — no meeting bot required.

**Current state:** The v1.0 UI is feature-complete. The frontend has been decomposed from a monolithic component into a multi-view architecture with HashRouter, 10 views, 5 context providers, and a shared AppShell. All Figma Make designs have been ported into the CRA + plain CSS codebase. In-client OAuth PKCE is working, OS dark mode detection is implemented, and new API endpoints support the home dashboard. See [SPEC.md](../SPEC.md) for the full feature inventory.

## Technology Decisions

| Component | Choice | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **Runtime** | Node.js 20+ | Best ecosystem for Zoom SDK and RTMS |
| **Frontend** | React 18 + CRA 5 | Industry standard, Zoom App compatible |
| **UI Library** | `@base-ui/react` + plain CSS | Unstyled, accessible, CSS custom properties |
| **Routing** | `react-router-dom@6` (HashRouter) | Hash-based routing safe for Zoom iframe |
| **Icons** | `lucide-react` | Lightweight, tree-shakeable icon library |
| **Fonts** | Source Serif 4 + Inter (self-hosted) | Zoom WebView blocks Google CDN fonts |
| **Backend** | Express.js (JavaScript) | Simple, flexible, well-documented |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL 15+ | Full-text search (GIN index), JSON support |
| **ORM** | Prisma | Type-safe, great migrations, modern |
| **AI Provider** | OpenRouter | Free models (Gemini Flash), no API key required |
| **RTMS SDK** | `@zoom/rtms` v1.0.2 | Class-based Client API, multi-meeting support |
| **Auth** | Zoom OAuth (PKCE) | Native to platform, httpOnly session cookies |
| **Containerization** | Docker Compose | Easy local dev, portable |

### Open Questions

| Question | Options | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Redis required? | Redis vs in-memory | Testing needed (currently in-memory) |
| File storage for VTT | Local disk vs S3 | Starting with local |
| Vector DB for RAG? | pgvector vs FTS only | Starting without (FTS works well) |
| Deployment target | Railway, Render, Fly.io | Document all options |
